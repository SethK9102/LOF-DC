# Packaging / dependency management (pick one; `poetry` recommended)
poetry

# Notes:
# - `sqlite3` is part of the Python stdlib and does NOT appear here.
# - Alternatives that were removed to avoid overlap:
#   * `tinydb` (lightweight DB) — removed in favor of `SQLAlchemy` for consistent persistence.
#   * `pip-tools` (lock tooling) — rely on `poetry` for dependency management and lockfiles.
#   * `numpy` — removed as combat math will not require heavy numeric libs; add later if needed.
# - Optional UI alternatives (uncomment if you switch stacks):
#   # python-tcod    # classic roguelike rendering & FOV (map-heavy, grid-based)
#   # pygame         # sprite/graphics + audio (if building a windowed graphical client)
# - Pin versions in production using `poetry lock` or an explicit lockfile.

## Notes

- This file is intended as a local snapshot for quick reference. It does not include issue bodies or comments. If you want a richer export (full bodies, comments, labels, assignees) I can use the GitHub API to create a CSV/JSON with full details — that requires no auth for public repos but will be more complete.
